Meu portfólio, com todos os meus projetos até o dia de hoje, experiências profissionais e instituições acadêmicas pelas quais passei.

## Issues

If you do find a bug, you can open an issue telling me with your best words what happened and, most importantly, **how it happened**. Then I'll do my best to fix it. :)

## Suggestions

Suggestions are welcome as well. If you have an idea of what could be added to the project or what could be improved, I would really like to know it.
> Some ideas may not work very well with the project, or may be to hard to develop, so I'm sorry if I can't make your suggestion come true. :(


## 💻 Requirements

**Development:**<br>
The app was developed with React.JS 16, so you'll need those to run the project locally (if you want to make changes to the code or use it as a template for your portfolio).


### Thank you for reading all these. 🏵️
